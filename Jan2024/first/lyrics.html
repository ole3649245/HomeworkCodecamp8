            First, I was afraid, I was petrified
            Kept thinking, 
            
            I could never live, without you by my side
            But then I spent so many nights thinking, how you did me wrong
            And I grew strong and I learned how to get along
            And so you're back, from outer space
            I just walked in to find you here
            With that sad look upon your face
            I should have changed that stupid lock
            I should have made you leave your key
            
            If I'd a known for just one second
            You'd be back to bother me
            Woah now go, walk out the door, just turn around now

            'Cause you're not welcome anymore
            Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
            Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?
            No, not I, I will survive
            Oh as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
            
            I've got all my life to live and I've got all my love to give
            And I'll survive, I will survive (hey, hey)
            It took all the strength not to fall apart
            Just trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
            And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself

            I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
            And you see me, somebody new
            I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
            
            And so you felt like dropping in, and just expect me to be free
            ut now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me
            Go on go, walk out the door, just turn around now
            'Cause you're not welcome anymore

            Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye
            Did you think I'd crumble, did you think I'd lay down and die?
            Oh no, not I, I will survive
            Oh as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive

            I've got all my life to live and I've got all my love to give
            And I'll survive, I will survive (oh)
            Go on now go, walk out the door, just turn around now
            'Cause you're not welcome anymore

            Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye

            Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

            Oh no, not I, I will survive
            Oh as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
            I've got my life to live and I've got all my love to give
            And I'll survive, I will survive

            I will survive
            At first, I was afraid, I was petrified
            Kept thinking, I could never live, without you by my side
            But then I spent so many nights thinking, how you did me wrong
            And I grew strong and I learned how to get along
            And so you're back, from outer space
